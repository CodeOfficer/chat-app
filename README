This is a small work in progress. 

NOTE: I've made modifications to the juggernaut gem and plugin to be able to pass users lists for channels.

General instructions are:

1. create and migrate the database
	rake db:create
	rake db:migrate

2. load the seed data
		rake db:seed

3. start the juggernaut server with the vendored gems executable:
		./vendor/gems/juggernaut-0.5.8/bin/juggernaut -c /<YOUR PATH>/chat-app/config/juggernaut.yml

4. start the rails app
		script/server

5. visit:
		http://localhost:3000/
